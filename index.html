									<p>YOU and your group of adventurers (3-4 players) find themselves in a universe where all the philosophers we've studied in class have split themselves into factions. Players must create their characters and choose as a group the faction they will align with. If there are multiple players who want to do so, they may also split into different groups to align with different factions. </p>
									<h3 id="factions">The Factions Are (with according BP numbers, see below):</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The Relationists
											<ul>
												<li>Overview: they place utmost value in human connection, relationships, and environmentalism. Their members are:</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Nel Noddings (25 BP)</li>
													<li>bell hooks (20 BP) </li>
													<li>Rosemary Radford Ruether (18 BP)</li>
													<li>Karl Marx (for his views on <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/deville/1883/peoples-marx/ch14.htm" target="_blank">the separation of craftsman from his product</a>) (20 BP)</li>
													<li>Tich Nhat Hanh (18 BP)</li>
													<li>Martin Heidegger (for his views on <a href="https://www.english.hawaii.edu/criticalink/heidegger/guide7.html#:~:text=In%20continuing%20on%20the%20path,has%20control%20over%20all%20existence." target="_blank">standing reserve</a>) (25 BP)</li>
												</ul>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>The Determinists
											<ul>
												<li>Overview: The Determinists are, well, determinists. They hold the idea that free will is an illusion, and that everything happens purely because of something else. Their members include:
												</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Emmanuel Kant (50 BP)</li>
													<li>Galen Strawson (18 BP)</li>
													<li>Lawrence Kohlberg (for his work on <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/aded5050/5050unit4/kohlberg.asp" target="_blank">moral development</a>) (40 BP)</li>
												</ul>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>The Teleologists</li>
										<ul>
												<li>Overview: The Teleologists are, as the name suggests, teleologists. The polar opposites of the Determinists, they believe that free will is real. They believe in intentions and end results - everything has a starting point and an intentional end point. Their members include:
												</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Jean-Paul Sarte (55 BP)</li>
													<li>Aristotle (20 BP)</li>
													<li>Enrique Dussel (18 BP)</li>
													<li>Alasdair MacIntyre (18 BP)</li>
												</ul>
											</ul>

									</ul>
									<p>Due to their conflicting idealologies, these factions are at war with one another, each trying to prove the other wrong; that ~thier~ philosophy is right.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Brain Power (BP)</h2>
									<p>Each player character has 80 BP (Brain Power). When that reaches zero, that player is OUT. No exceptions. Each enemy character has a different amount of BP depending on how much attention they got in class, with a minimum of 18 BP and a maximum  of 55 BP.</p>
									<p></p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Example Cards and Questions</h2>
									<p>As mentioned in the <strong>Battle Mechanics</strong> section below, there are three tiers of cards, as well as <strong> Action Cards</strong>. Starting with the battle cards:
										<ul>
											<li>Tier One (Fast Facts). 1d8</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Philosopher lifespan (birth year  - death year)</li>
												<li>Philosopher nationality</li>
												<li>Political events possibly influencing the philosophical movement</li>
												<li>Names of philosophers in the faction (must get 50% correct)</li>
											</ul>
											<li>Tier Two (Understanding) 1d10</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Overview of a philosophy: multiple choice or open-ended</li>
													<li>Read a short passage of their beliefs and rephrase in your own words</li>
												</ul>
											<li>Tier Three (Real World Applications) 1d20</li>
												<ul>
													<li>The card will give a situation and the player decides which philosophy it falls under</li>
													<li>The player needs to do some quick thinking/research and come up with a current event that works with the philosophy at hand</li>
													<li>"What would this philosopher have thought?"</li>
												</ul>
										</ul>
										<h4>Action Cards</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Skip! Self-explanatory. If you read the card and realize you don't know it, you skip - thus avoiding taking any damage for a wrong answer!</li>
											<li>Sacrifice. You sacrifice 40% of your health for a guaranteed correct answer.</li>
											<li>Double it! You double your damage to the enemy if you answer correctly, but double your self-damage if you answer incorrectly.</li>
											<li>Redraw. if you don't know the answer, you can redraw for a different question.</li>
										</ul>		

										</ul></p>

									<h2>Battle Mechanics</h2>
									<h3>This game takes inspiration from tabletop RPG games like DnD, as well as combat-based card games like MtG and Gwent. How the party gets to combat depends on what the DM wants their group to experience. But! Once you do get to combat, here's how it works: </h3>
									<p>Players roll die to determine who goes first; whoever has the highest number goes first, and the lowest number goes last. This applies to the enemy character as well.
										<br>
										Before starting combat, all players draw two <strong>Action Cards</strong>. These action cards will allow players to perfom actions, such as <strong>Skip/pass, Redraw, Double-or-Nothing, or Sacrifice.</strong>
										<br>
										Once everyone has three <strong>Action Cards,</strong> players may now begin combat. Keeping in their turn order, players roll a d4 to determine if they are able to draw from the attack card pile or not. If they roll a 1, they miss their shot and must wait until their next turn. Otherwise, they may proceed.
										<br>
										Each type of card is worth different points. Cards from the <strong>Fast Facts</strong> pile are worth 1d8. Cards from the <strong>Understanding</strong> pile are worth 1d10. Cards from the <strong>Real World Applications</strong> pile are worth 1d20.
										<br>
										If the player answers the question on the card correctly, they may roll the corresponding die to do that amount of damage - however, if they roll less than 25% of that die's max, they do zero damage. If they answer incorrectly, they roll the corresponding die and <i>take</i> damage instead of dishing it out. The cycle repeats until either the enemy or the player characters have been defeated (<strong>BP</strong> down to zero). The players then move on to the next member of the enemy faction(s).
